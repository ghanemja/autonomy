Raspberry Pi Camera Setup
=========================

In this class we'll be exploring how to use ROS to connect to a virtual camera in simulation or a real camera.

Camera Types
============

when a camera takes an image it basically takes all the light that's just bouncing around in the world it
focuses it through a lens through an aperture and onto a sensor and that data is then stored as a 2d array of
measurements that are called pixels now for a grayscale image this is pretty straightforward each pixel just measures
the intensity of the light that hits it but for colored images it gets a bit more complex there are a few different methods that 

Installations 
=============

.. note::
    Here, we assume you're setting up a camera on the Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 used as a robot computer with the user name
    ``neet`` per our class setup convention. If you're using a different user name, then modify these instructions as 
    appropriate. 

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ sudo apt update

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ sudo apt upgrade

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ sudo apt install libraspberrypi-bin v4l-utils ros-humble-v4l2-camera


.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ sudo apt install ros-humble-image-transport-plugins


.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-01:~$ sudo apt install ros-humble-rqt-image-view


After installating the above, run the command ``groups`` to see which groups the current user is part of

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ groups

and you'll receive an output similar to the following 

.. code-block:: bash
    neet adm dialout cdrom sudo audio video plugdev games users input render netdev gpio spi i2c

Make sure the user ``neet`` belongs to the video group as illustrated above. 

.. note:: 
    If you don't see video in your group listing, you'll need to add the user ``neet`` as follows 

    .. code-block:: bash 
        neet@am-robot-xx:~$ sudo usermod -aG video neet

    After running this command, you should log off the robot computer and then reboot it. 

Enable the Camera
=================

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ sudo apt-get install raspi-config


After this installation run the following 

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ sudo raspi-config

- Step 1: select ``3 Interface Options ... ``
- Step 2: select ``I1 Legacy Camera ... ``
- Step 3: Would you like to enable legacy camera support? ``Yes``
- Step 4: click ``Ok``
- Step 5: select ``3 Interface Options ... ``
- Step 6: select ``I4 SPI Enable/disable automatic ...``
- Step 7: Would you like the SPI interface to be enabled? ``Yes``
- Step 8: The SPI interface is enabled. Click ``Ok``
- Step 9: select ``3 Interface Options ... ``
- Step 10: select ``I5 I2C Enable/disable automatic ...``
- Step 11: Would you like the ARM I2C interface to be enabled? ``Yes`` 
- Step 12: The ARM I2C interface is enabled. Click ``Ok``
- Step 13: select ``Finish``
- Step 14: Would you like to reboot now? ``Yes``

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ vcgencmd get_camera 

You should receive the following output

.. code-block:: bash 

    supported=1 detected=1, libcamera interfaces=0

If the camera isn't detected, please check to ribbon cable to make sure its properly inserted. If this doesn't solve the problem, you may have a defective camera. 

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-01:~$ ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node --ros-args -p image_size:="[640,480]" -p camera_frame_id:=camera_optical_link


For this next step, you'll type the following command on a terminal window on your **development** computer 

.. code-block:: bash

    user@am-dev-xx:~$ ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
