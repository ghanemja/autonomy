===========================
Headless Raspberry Pi Setup
===========================

These instructions illustrate how to setup Ubuntu 22.04.x and ROS2 Humble on your robot using a 
*headless setup* without a keyboard, mouse, or monitor. 


1 Setup Requirements
====================

To get your robot's computer ready for a headless setup, you'll need the following items handy

	1) a development PC 
	2) Raspberry Pi 4 (for your robot)
	3) Raspberry Pi Power Supply
	4) microSD memory card
	5) Raspberry Pi Imager software


2 Create an Ubuntu 22.04.x Image for Raspberry Pi 
=================================================

2.1 Step 1: Download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager  on your PC 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the `Raspberry Pi Imager <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`_ that matches your 
operating system (Windows, MacOX, or Linux). The Pi Imager allows you to flash the Ubuntu operating system to a microSD which is 
used by the Raspberry Pi 4. 

If your PC or MAC doesn't have a microSD port, but it does have an SD or a USB port, you'll need to use a  
microSD-to-SD adapter or a microSD-to-USB adapter, respectively, to image the microSD. 

2.2 Step 2: Open up the Raspberry Pi Imager
-------------------------------------------
Open the Raspberry Pi Imager and make the following settings:

.. figure:: images/RPI_Imager01.png
		:width: 682px
		:height: 482px
		:align: center
		:scale: 60 %
		
|	

	a) Raspberry Pi Device: choose the device as the Raspberry Pi 4;
	b) Operating System: choose the Ubuntu Server 22.04.x operating system within the dropdown menu (``Other general-purpose OS --> Ubuntu --> Ubuntu Server 22.04.x LTS (64-bit)``);
	c) Storage: choose your storage device (the microSD card). 

.. note:: If you're using the Anker microSD to USB adapter, your storage device will say something like "NORELSYS 1081 CS0 USB Device - X GB".
	

2.3 Step 3: Use OS customisation?
---------------------------------
Click ``NEXT`` and another popup window will say ``Use OS customization?`` as shown below.

.. figure:: images/RPI_Imager02.png

		:height: 168px
		:align: center
		:scale: 70 %
		
|	

Now, click the ``EDIT SETTINGS`` option and you'll see the following three tabs: ``GENERAL``, ``SERVICES``, and ``OPTIONS``. We'll examine the settings under
each tab in the following three sections. 

2.3.1 GENERAL Tab 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: images/RPI_Imager03.png
			:width: 541px
			:height: 662px
			:align: center
			:scale: 70 %

|

On the ``GENERAL`` 	tab, make the settings shown above, with

	- Set hostname: am-robot-xx (where xx can be any number greater than 30. For our robots, we'll use 30, 40, and 50)
	- Set username and password
		- Username: neet 
		- Password: neet1234

			
2.3.2 SERVICES Tab 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: images/RPI_Imager04.png
		:width: 541px
		:height: 662px
		:align: center
		:scale: 60 %

|

On the ``SERVICES`` tab, make the settings shown above.

2.3.2 OPTIONS Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: images/RPI_Imager05.png
		:width: 541px
		:height: 662px
		:align: center
		:scale: 60 %

|

On the ``OPTIONS`` tab, make the settings shown above.
	
After clicking ``SAVE``, you see the following two questions (click ``YES`` to accept): 
	
	- "Would you like to apply OS customization setings?" ``YES``
	- "All existing data on 'NORELSYS 1081CSO USB Device' will erased. Are you sure you want to continue?" ``YES`` 

After clicking continue, you'll see the following screen.

.. figure:: images/RPI_Imager06.png
		:width: 682px
		:height: 482px
		:align: center
		:scale: 70 %

|

Once complete, you'll see the following screen.

3 Remote Login to Raspberry Pi 
==============================
After you've flashed Ubuntu 22.04.x on your microSD card, you can plug it into your Raspberry Pi, but make sure your Raspberry Pi is powered off.
The Raspberry Pi should automatically connect to our network, but you'll need to get its IP address for remote logging in. 

3.1 Download IP Address Scanner 
-------------------------------
To determine the IP address of your robot's Raspberry Pi, you'll need to use a IP address scanner such as 
`Angry IP Scanner <https://angryip.org/download/>`_. 

On Ubuntu, download version that says ``x86 64-bit DEB Package for Ubuntu/Debian/Mint``

In your downloads folder, you should now have a file with a similar name as the following

.. code-block:: bash

    ipscan_3.9.1_amd64.deb

Navigate to your downloads folder

``~/Downloads/ipscan_3.9.1_amd64.deb``

.. code-block:: bash 

    $ cd ~/Downloads 

Now, list the files inside this directory to make it is there.

.. code-block:: bash 

    $ ls -l
	
Once downloaded, 

.. code-block:: bash 

    sudo dpkg -i ipscan_3.9.1_amd64.deb

Open up Angry IP Scanner.

Select MAC Vendor
Press start

Sort the list by clicking Ports
Under Hostname, find the robot. In this case, am-robot-01.local.

Note the ip address. 

.. code-block::  bash

    $ ssh neet@ip-address

Once you have connected to the Raspberry Pi, you should receive a message similar 
to the following

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$

Also, at the top of your terminal window, you'll see ``neet@am-robot-xx:~$``

Now you can finish the Ubuntu installation 

.. code-block:: bash

    neet@am-robot-xx:~$ sudo apt update

.. code-block:: bash

    neet@am-robot-01:~$ sudo apt upgrade

After the upgrade process has completed, go ahead and install ROS 2 Humble using the 
instructions given on this page. 

See screenshots on ubuntu home computer.

.. code-block:: bash 
 
    neet@am-robot-01:~$ sudo apt autoremove

.. code-block:: bash 

    neet@am-robot-01:~$ sudo reboot

Now wait for about 2 minutes for the Raspberry Pi to reboot. If you receive the following 
message

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.29 port 22: Connection refused

The Raspberry Pi might still be rebooting, so wait a bit longer. If after waiting and 
still no connection, run Angry IP Scanner again to make sure the IP address hasn't 
changed. If after verifying the IP address and you're still unable to connect, please
see your instructor or TA and perhaps they can help resolve the issue. 

.. note::
    To obtain the IP address for a computer that your currently connected to, you can type the following 

    .. code-block:: bash
	
        $ hostname -I 

Test Communication Between Computers
------------------------------------

To determine if your computer can communicate with another computer, you can use the ``ping`` command using 
the IP address of the computer you want to communicate with. For instance, let's say the IP address of the 
computer you would like to communicate with has an IP address of xyz.abc.jkl.z, then you can issue the command 

.. code-block:: bash 

    ping xyz.abc.jkl.z
