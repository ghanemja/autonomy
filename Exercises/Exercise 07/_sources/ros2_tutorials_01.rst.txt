ROS 2 Humble Tutorials, Part 1 
==============================

.. _ROS Domain ID:

1 ROS_DOMAIN_ID Variable
------------------------
ROS 2 allows the flow of information between all computers connected to the same network, either physically connected or via WiFi. 
ROS 2 nodes on the same domain can freely discover and send messages to each other, while ROS 2 nodes on different domains cannot. 
All ROS 2 nodes use domain ID 0 by default. To avoid interference between different groups of computers running ROS 2 on the same network, 
a different domain ID should be set for each group.

Before you begin these tutorials, you should set your domain ID to the same as your development computer. 
So, if your development computer is ``am-dev-01``, you would set your domain ID to to 1 (don't place the 0 in front of the 1). 
 
In a terminal window, to set your domain ID (for am-dev-xx), you would type

.. code-block:: bash

	user@am-dev-xx:~$ export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=xx
	
.. note::
	If your development computer is ``am-dev-01``, ``am-dev-02``, ``am-dev-03``, etc., you would set your domain ID to 1, 2, 3, etc.
