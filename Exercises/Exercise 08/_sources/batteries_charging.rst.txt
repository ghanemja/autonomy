Batteries/Charging
==================

You can charge your batteries directly via your Tello or you can use Tello Battery Charging Hub. 

Charging via the Tello
----------------------

To charge a battery with via the Tello itself, use a USB Type-A to micro USB cable, placing the USB Type-A end into an appropriate USB 5V power supply and 
the micro USB end into the Tello's micro USB Port.

The Tello charging hub can accommodate up to three batteries at the same time, and it charges each battery 
in sequence according to their voltage levels, from the highest voltage to lowest voltage---this will give you a fully-charged battery 
quickest. Each battery can take an hour or more to fully charge, depending on their discharge level 
and the amperage of charger being used. The lights next to each battery have the following meanings:

a) Solid Yellow -- waiting to be charged
b) Flashing Green --- charging
c) Solid Green --- fully charged
