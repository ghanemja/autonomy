Linux Overview
==============

In this class we will use ROS on a **Linux** **Debian** distribution called **Ubuntu**. There are many resources on the Internet related to 
the various Linux distributions, but quit frankly, for a beginner, all of the terminology can be a bit overwhelming. 
To help minimize any possible confusion down the road, let's briefly look at a few important items.

1 Linux (Brief History)
========================

1.1 Unix 
--------

`Unix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix>`_ (YOO-niks) refers to a family of multitasking, multi-user computer operating 
systems that derive from an original version develped by Bell Laboratories in 1969. Since that time, Unix and other Unix-like 
operating systems have evolved, with Linux as one these systems. 

1.2 Linux 
---------

`Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_  (LIN-uuks) refers to an open-source Unix-like kernel and a generic name for a 
family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system 
kernel first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged 
as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel, supporting system software, and libraries. 
Debian is one of several Linux distributions.  


1.3 Debian 
----------

`Debian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian>`_  refers to a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source 
software and optionally non-free firmware or software developed by the community-supported Debian Project. The first 
version of Debian was released in 1993. Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel.

1.4 Ubuntu 
----------

`Ubuntu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu>`_  (uu-BUUN-too) referes to a Linux distribution derived from Debian and 
comprised mostly of free and open-source software. Ubuntu has the following official editions: a) Desktop, b) Server, c) and
Core for the Internet of Things and other imbedded devices. 

Since the release of the first version in 2004, Ubuntu has become one of the most popular Linux distributions for general purposes 
and it has a large online presence. Numerous community-editions of Ubuntu also exist, 
in `flavors <https://ubuntu.com/desktop/flavours>`_, such as **Edubuntu**, **Kubuntu**, **Ubuntu MATE**, **Xubuntu**, and several others. 

	
.. note::
	In this class, we'll use the desktop version of Ubuntu on our development machines (``am-dev-xx``), and we'll use the server version on our robots (``am-robot-xx``). 


2 Linux Command Line for Beginners
==================================

Although Ubuntu Desktop has a graphical user interface (GUI) that uses a mouse for screen navigation, you will primarily use a
**command line terminal** with ROS. As you will learn, the command line allows you to perform a variety of tasks much quicker
than using the GUI. Many of these tasks include a) executing ROS commands, b) updating packages, c) installing applications, 
d) setting up a communications port, e) downloading/uploading files, f) creating directories, g) copying files, h) moving files, etc. 

If you have little or no experience using the Linux command line, please go through this 
tutorial `The Linux command line for beginners <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview>`_ as it contains a lot of important 
information.
