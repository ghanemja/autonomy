Programming via DJITelloPy
===========================

For this section you'll see how to write a program using the `DJITelloPy <https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy>`_ library as well as using OpenCV to view images from the camera



1 Installations
===============
First, you'll need to install the following libraries using ``pip``:

	1) `djitellopy <https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master>`_
	2) `opencv <https://opencv.org/>`_ 
	3) `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ 
	4) `pygame <https://www.pygame.org/>`_
	
.. code-block:: bash 

	# install dijtellopy
	pip install djitellopy
	
.. code-block:: bash 

	# install opencv 
	pip install opency-python
	
.. code-block:: bash 

	# install numpy 
	pip install numpy==1.26.4
	
.. code-block:: bash 

	# install pygame 
	pip install pygame
	
	
2 Download Tello_Example02.py 
=============================
This second example employs the same sequence of drone commands as our first example, but this time we'll use the ``DJITellopy`` library to simplify the overall program construction.
You can find all of the commands listed in this example at `DJITelloPy API Reference <https://djitellopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tello/>`_.

Open VSCode and save the program  as ``Tello_Example02.py`` inside your ``tello`` folder. 

.. literalinclude:: code/Tello_Example02.py
	:language: Python
	:linenos:
	:caption: Tello_Example02.py

As you can see, we've executed the same drone commands as our first example but this time with 82 lines of code less. 

3 Example with Camera Feed
==========================
This third example was taken directly from the `DJITello GitHhub site <https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/examples/manual-control-pygame.py>`_. This code has a camera feed and 
it allows you to manually control the Tello using your keyboard. 

.. note:: When you're manually controlling the Tello via the keyboard, make sure to keep the mouse cursor within the video frame (Tello video stream). Otherwise, your keyboard presses will 
	appear other currently open windows, and will have no effect on controlling the Tello. 
	
.. literalinclude:: code/Tello_Example03.py
	:language: Python
	:linenos:
